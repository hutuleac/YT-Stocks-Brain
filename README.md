# YT Stocks Brain

Structured research briefs generated from YouTube videos (investing, AI/tech, and mixed-topic
podcasts). Each brief is a standalone, mobile-friendly HTML page built from the video's
transcript, organized by theme rather than fixed category tables.

**Browse live:** https://hutuleac.github.io/YT-Stocks-Brain/

- `index.html` — searchable index of every brief (all briefs / by channel / by company-ticker)
- `<channel>_<date>_<title>.html` — individual briefs
- `research-data/` — archived transcripts, JSON, and data files behind each brief
- `library.json` — machine-readable manifest of every brief and its extracted entities

Briefs are generated with the `yt-stocks-brain` skill (`skill/yt-stocks-brain/`: `start.py` to fetch and clean, `generate.py` to build, `finish.py` to archive, check and commit). See `CLAUDE.md` for the layout.

The index and every brief are fully responsive. Open the live link above in your mobile
