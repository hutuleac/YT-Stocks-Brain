    "serving active traders (now #1 in options market share), becoming a lifelong 'financial home' "
    "(Trump accounts, trusts, joint accounts, banking with a high direct-deposit attach rate), and "
    "new product categories (prediction markets, agentic trading, Robinhood Chain).",
    "Robinhood launched agentic trading and an agentic card — any AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) "
    "can trade equities and soon options/crypto via an MCP server; over 100,000 accounts created so far.",
    "Tenev is pushing hard into private markets: Robinhood Ventures Fund 1 (late-stage pre-IPO, holds "
    "OpenAI) and Fund 2 (seed/series A, partnered with Y Combinator) — both built only with the "
    "portfolio company's consent, unlike some competitors who don't ask first.",
    "Robinhood Chain, launched weeks ago, is already top-5 in DEX volume — it lets non-US customers "
    "(120+ countries) hold tokenized stocks (Tesla, Nvidia) and trade/swap/lend/borrow them onchain "
    "like crypto, settled via the USDG stablecoin built with Paxos.",
    "Tenev flags a valuation warning sign: a sudden spike in customer requests for Korean stocks (vs. "
    "none historically), plus hedge funds buying AI chips purely to resell at a markup rather than for "
    "use — a pattern he says is how fundamentally sound assets like chips can still get overheated.",
    "A California billionaire wealth tax could force Tenev to sell Robinhood shares (most of his wealth "
    "is HOOD stock); he draws a parallel to Hollywood's decade-long exodus from policy own-goals and "
    "notes some wealthy taxpayers have already left the state pre-emptively.",
    "Internally, Robinhood's AI adoption is 'close to 100%' among engineers — the job has shifted from "
    "writing/reviewing code to managing fleets of coding agents around the clock.",
    "Personal notes: Tenev is long-term bullish on Bitcoin ('singular,' the original trusted brand) but "
    "won't give a price target; keeps a nightly journaling + physical-book wind-down routine instead of "
    "phone/Slack before bed; and predicts more software engineers and lawyers will exist in 2035, not fewer.",
