    "Solo dev-career essay arguing most developers quietly stop improving through three sneaky, individually 'productive-feeling' habits rather than one dramatic failure.",
    "Habit 1: clinging to one familiar stack (his own example: Spring Boot + Angular) as an identity/hiding spot rather than a deliberate choice.",
    "Habit 2: mistaking 'the way we've always done it' for expertise — enabled by companies that promote on tenure more than range or curiosity.",
    "Habit 3: inability to function without AI assistance — cites (unnamed) research that devs who lean on AI heavily perform worse once it's removed, because struggle is where learning happens.",
    "Unifying thesis: all three are 'friction avoidance in a hoodie' — growth lives specifically in the friction people are avoiding.",
    "Explicit non-anti-AI disclaimer: he uses Claude Code daily and isn't asking viewers to abandon AI tools, just to notice when a tool has replaced thinking rather than accelerated it.",
