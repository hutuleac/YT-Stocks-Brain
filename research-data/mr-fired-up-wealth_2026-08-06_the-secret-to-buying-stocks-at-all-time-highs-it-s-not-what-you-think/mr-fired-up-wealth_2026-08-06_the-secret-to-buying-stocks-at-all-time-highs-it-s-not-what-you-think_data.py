    "Dense earnings week: Mercado Libre, Celsius, Uber, AppLovin, DataDog, and Wingstop all reported, plus a callback to SiTime's strong post-earnings pop.",
    "The only stock the host says he's actively buying right now is Mercado Libre (MELI) — a ~50% revenue beat sent shares down 7% anyway, which he attributes to a soft 6.7% operating margin as management deliberately prioritizes long-term growth investment over near-term profit.",
    "Celsius and Wingstop both missed and sold off hard (-16% and fundamentals \"broken down,\" respectively) — used as the evidence base for his \"K-shaped economy\" thesis: asset owners/high earners riding the market higher while lower-income, labor-dependent consumers get squeezed by inflation, including rising gas prices cutting into discretionary spend.",
    "Uber's headline 11.7% revenue growth looks weak but is distorted by a one-time UK tax accounting reclassification — real platform metrics (gross bookings +22-24%, trips +18%) show a much healthier business, and the company threw off $10.1B of free cash flow this quarter.",
    "AppLovin posted some of the strongest profitability metrics in the group (88% gross margin, higher net income per employee than Nvidia) but fell ~20% on the print — the host isn't buying, citing sentiment risk that reminds him of Trade Desk's collapse, not a fundamentals problem.",
    "DataDog was trimmed a few days before this video; the host argues its ~15% earnings-day drop is normal SaaS-name volatility and that it should be valued on EV/revenue rather than its scary-looking ~116 P/E, flagging renewed interest tied to AI-observability demand from OpenAI and Anthropic.",

    {"term": "K-shaped economy/recovery", "def": "An economic pattern where different segments of society or industries move in opposite directions at once — here, asset owners/high earners benefiting from rising markets while lower-income, labor-dependent consumers are squeezed by inflation."},
    {"term": "PEG ratio", "def": "Price/earnings divided by expected earnings growth; used here to judge whether a stock's P/E is justified by its growth rate (AppLovin's 0.39 GAAP TTM PEG is cited as attractive since under 1.0 is generally considered cheap)."},
    {"term": "Operating EBIT margin vs. gross profit margin", "def": "Gross margin measures the profitability of the core product/service itself; operating margin measures what's left after running the whole business (people, marketing, tech, overhead) — the distinction the host uses to explain why Mercado Libre's report looked weaker than its top-line numbers suggested."},
    {"term": "Fibonacci retracement levels (S1/S2/S3, R3)", "def": "Chart-based support/resistance levels the host uses only after a stock has passed his fundamental research process, to help time entries/exits — not a stock-picking method on its own."},
    {"term": "Contra revenue / revenue reclassification", "def": "An accounting treatment (as seen in Uber's UK \"taxi tax\" VAT rule change) that reduces reported revenue without changing the underlying economics (gross profit, EBITDA, free cash flow) of the business."},
    {"term": "EV/revenue vs. P/E", "def": "For recurring-revenue SaaS businesses like DataDog, the host argues enterprise-value-to-revenue is the more appropriate valuation multiple than price-to-earnings, which can look artificially extreme for high-growth, reinvestment-heavy software companies."},
