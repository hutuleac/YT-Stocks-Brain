SNAPSHOT = [
    "Kyle's \"everything bull market\" thesis: a Goldilocks macro backdrop (ISM >56, cooling inflation, low hiring) plus an AI stack that is ROI-positive at every layer.",
    "AI lets companies grow earnings without growing headcount — profit-per-employee rises, which keeps growth non-inflationary and keeps the Fed on hold.",
    "Kalshi/Polymarket odds of a September rate hike fell from ~60% to ~29% (71% chance the Fed holds), with the hold priced in for most Fed meetings through January.",
    "Anthropic hit a $65B annualized revenue run rate, OpenAI $40B — combined run rate expected near $200B by year-end 2026, and Anthropic cited as targeting $250-400B run rate by end of 2027 (per All-In Podcast).",
    "Kyle argues AI creates more jobs, not fewer, in the near term — companies want more AI-literate hires because profit per employee goes up; robotics disruption is pushed out to 2029-2030.",
    "Demand is arriving in overlapping waves — chat, then enterprise agents (already underway), consumer agents (kicking off late 2026 via Apple/Google), then physical AI — unlike the internet buildout's sequential fiber-then-mobile waits.",
    "Kyle's portfolio strategy is a barbell: infrastructure basket (memory, GPUs, semis, compute, power) plus application-layer winners (e.g. Eli Lilly, SaaS), buying into fear rather than euphoria.",
    "Heavy self-promotion throughout for Milk Road Pro's price increase (Aug 25 deadline) and a Saber Money sponsor read — excluded from the substantive brief below.",
