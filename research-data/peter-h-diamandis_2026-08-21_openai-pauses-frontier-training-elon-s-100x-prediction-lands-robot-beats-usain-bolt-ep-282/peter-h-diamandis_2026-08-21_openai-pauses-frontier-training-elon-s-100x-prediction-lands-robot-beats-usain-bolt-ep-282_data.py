    "OpenAI announced it voluntarily paused 'some' frontier reinforcement-learning training, citing alignment/safety standards — the panel splits between reading this as a real governance response (10% of frontier-lab compute reportedly now goes to monitoring RL runs) and as pre-IPO/pre-Xi-visit marketing that flatters Washington while implying the models are too powerful to release.",
    "Tim Sweeney flagged that Elon's January prediction of 100x intelligence gains at fixed model size has 'landed'; Elon replied specialized models add another 100x on top — the panel debates whether that's really a new axis (specialization) or just sparsification of one generalist model, while a separate 'gauge rotation' technique now lets labs merge/compare models without retraining from scratch.",
    "A Stanford paper found 98% overlap in reasoning pathways across top LLMs — models are converging because they increasingly train on each other's synthetic output — and an Anthropic paper showed 'mind viruses' (self-propagating ideas) can now spread horizontally between AI agents without the agent knowing it's been infected.",
    "Anthropic is reportedly structuring a super-voting share class to keep founder control after its IPO (Polymarket prices the IPO near $2T, ahead of SpaceX); Dario Amodei owns only ~2% of the company, and the panel debates whether his disease-curing mission and regulatory positioning (SB53) are sincere, savvy regulatory capture, or both.",
    "Memory has overtaken GPUs as the binding AI constraint: prices are up 500% in 12 months, SK Hynix says 2027 will be the worst supply year in the industry's history, and Solidigm's margins jumped from 3.9% to 47.7% in six months — while 'etched' weight chips promise a 100-1,000x follow-on breakthrough.",
    "Unitree's newest humanoid robot beat Usain Bolt's top speed by leg-optimizing its mass budget, reviving a debate over whether the future is one general-purpose humanoid body or many specialized ones; Zipline and Uber Eats announced a partnership targeting 1 million autonomous drone deliveries a day.",
    "Moderna and Merck's personalized mRNA melanoma vaccine hit its Phase 3 endpoint (stock +110%, the biggest single-day S&P 500 pop on record) the same week a new AI 'virtual cell' simulator (IDO, from a David Baker-cofounded team) launched aiming to make wet-lab biology experiments computable in silico first.",

            "Dave's historical context: pre-IPO super-voting stock was long taboo (Michael Sailor kept his at MicroStrategy despite Goldman Sachs refusing to underwrite the deal over it, which later enabled the Bitcoin strategy); it became fashionable after Google/Meta's 10-for-1 structures but has never before been installed retroactively — Anthropic's move would be a first. Sam Altman reportedly owns roughly 0% of OpenAI yet retains full effective control.",

Only 2% of the world's memory chips are made in the US; global production is rising ~20%/year while AI memory demand grows closer to 200%/year.",
