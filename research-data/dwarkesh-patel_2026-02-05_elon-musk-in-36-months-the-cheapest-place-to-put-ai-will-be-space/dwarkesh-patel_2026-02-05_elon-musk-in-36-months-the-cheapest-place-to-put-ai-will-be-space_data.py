    "Musk's headline claim: within 36 months (probably closer to 30), space will be the cheapest place to run AI compute — solar panels get ~5x the output with no atmosphere loss and no battery cost, making it roughly 10x cheaper than terrestrial power once launch costs fall.",
    "The near-term constraint is power, not chips: gas-turbine blade casting is backlogged (only 3 companies worldwide make them), solar tariffs of \"several hundred percent\" are choking domestic supply, and Musk predicts chip production will outpace the ability to \"turn chips on\" by the end of this year.",
    "xAI's mission (\"understand the universe\") is explicitly built on propagating intelligence and consciousness into the future — Musk predicts AI will exceed the sum of human intelligence within 5-6 years and says he doesn't believe humans will remain \"in control\" of something vastly smarter than them.",
    "Musk's real business thesis: once AI can fully emulate a human at a computer (\"digital human emulation\"), companies gain access to trillions in revenue overnight — he cites customer service alone as a near-$1-trillion, low-barrier beachhead market.",
    "Optimus faces three genuinely hard problems (real-world intelligence, the hand, and manufacturing at scale) and Tesla is building an \"Optimus Academy\" of 10,000-30,000 physical robots for real-world self-play to close the sim-to-real gap.",
    "Musk argues the US \"cannot win on the human front\" against China (1/4 the population, and in his view a higher average work ethic) and is betting robotics — plus new domestic lithium and nickel refineries — is the only lever left.",
    "Starship's steel-over-carbon-fiber pivot (steel is ~50x cheaper and matches carbon fiber's strength-to-weight at cryogenic temperatures) is framed as a mistake Musk now says should have been the starting choice, and the last major unsolved problem is a truly reusable heat shield.",
    "On DOGE, Musk defends a disputed, much larger fraud estimate than a cited 2024 Inspector General report found, and separately defends the Twitter acquisition and backing Trump's election as net-positive for civilization's odds of reaching Mars.",

            "A concrete DOGE change Musk credits with real, if modest, savings: making a payment appropriation code and a comment-field explanation mandatory (not optional) on the Treasury's central payment system, which processes roughly 5 trillion payments a year — he estimates this alone could save $100-200 billion/year.",
            "On politics more broadly, Musk defends both the Twitter acquisition and backing Trump's election as \"good for civilization,\" reasoning that a strong, functional America is necessary to reach Mars and to prevent AI/robotics progress from being suppressed by an oppressive state — and separately argues government, not corporations, is the bigger risk for AI misuse, calling government \"the biggest corporation with a monopoly on violence.\"",
