    "Memphis today holds ~1.5–2 GW of compute; the earnings call pointed at 5–10 GW total — more than the city's own 3.5 GW record peak demand, and 6–10 nuclear reactors' worth of power, to be met with gas generation.",
    "Self-funding is only partial: a 3–6 month lag between spend and revenue on an 8 GW/year pace is a $100–200B hole, and SpaceX itself expects to be cash-flow negative until 2030–2035.",
    "Both are demand bulls — 90–95% of businesses haven't figured out how to use what already exists, and real-world (visual/audio) intelligence needs orders of magnitude more compute.",
